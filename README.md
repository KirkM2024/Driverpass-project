# Driverpass-project
This is a brieft summary of the Driverpass project for The Southern New Hampshire University.
This buisiness design document was for a driving school company that wanted to expand their business into the Internet.
It was required that students could take online tests that were in line with the Department of Motor Vehicles written driver test.
The system should allow users to log in and students to select a package plan for personal instruction as well as accomodate diverent levels of access and communication features.

I feel like an are i did particularly well getting a grasp of what the client wanted in the design document.
It is important to get the initial impression of the customer desires early so you can start the project in accordance to what they desire so you can
reduce revisions.
If there was something i could revise it would be the relationship chart.
My approach was building as i reviewed the design draft.
